### WHO

Hey what's up? Full name's Rafael but everyone calls me Raf. I'm a front-end developer born & raised in Belgium, but currently working in London at NEVERBLAND.

Fluent in HTML5 CSS3 Sass Less and improving on my JavaScript jQuery every day. I know my way around WordPress and I've recently started experimenting with REST APIs using React.
